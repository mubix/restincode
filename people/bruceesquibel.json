	"maintext" : "<p>Bruce Esquibel, also known as \"Dr. Ripco,\" ran a long-standing Chicago-based BBS known as Ripco BBS. Recognized as one of Chicago's most notable BBSes, it was well-known for being a freewheeling, wide-ranging board. On May 8, 1990, Agents of the United States Secret Service, along with police and telephone company security personnel, executed thirty-two search warrants across the United States in Operation Sun Devil. Ripco BBS was swept up during the raids. The actions of the Secret Service in confiscating the board's equipment constituted an infringement on freedom, underlining the critical role BBSes play as platforms for exchanging thoughts and disseminating information. Ripco became reborn as an ISP in the 1990s.</p>",
